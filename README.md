## Game Mechanics


### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)

Difficulty exists as a relative expression, a difference between the player and the game's challenge. It is integral when thinking about 
difficulty to factor in the difficulty relative to the player and the players' assumed understanding of the game systems, goals, and means. 

When players play a stage that is ridiculously hard or way too easy, they would probably quit the game because it is moderately
frustrating or boring. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment is a system designed to balance the spectrum, making it easier for players who are  struggling, without making the game easier for better players who would like a more challenging game.

Here are some details about the possible features a DDA could effect if implemented in 'Prisma'.

• Increase/ Decrease AI's health: The AI would require more hits by the player in order to be destroyed, vice versa an AI would require  less hits to make them fall.

• Player buff/debuff: In relation to a buff, this would link into increasing the amount of damage a player outputs and inflicts upon enemy AI. Whilst a debuff would lead to the player's damage output would be significantly dampened, thus causing movement to become a  crucial game component for players to rely on as AI require more hits but still relay the same if not more damage depending on the DDA's current settings in relation to a scenario.      

•  AI's accuracy increase/decrease: The rate at which an AI hits a player would increase as the probability of a miss and distance would decrease. Inversely the rate at which an AI hits the player would decrease as the probability of a miss and the distance between the player and bullets would increase.

•  AI more agile (Faster/Dodges More)

•  AI less agile (Slower/Dodges Less)

•  More aggressive nature

•  Less aggressive nature

•  More Cautious nature

•  Less Cautious nature

Though game adjustment is not soley focused on increasing player attributes or decreasing when the player is finding the experience to hard or to easy; it is a design problem that involves estimating when and how to intervene. Keeping the player challenged and interested is especially difficult in interactive contexts. One common approach to player investment is the flow model developed by M. Csikszentmihalyi.
